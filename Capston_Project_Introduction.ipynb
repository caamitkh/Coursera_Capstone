As Indian population is rising in Toronto, want of Indian food & grocery is increasing. A restaurant chain name XYZ, which is poupular in India is interested to open an Indian restaurant in Toronto. They want to anlyse how the existing Indian restaurants in Toronto are distributed among the neighborhoods.   \n\nWith the help of data science we will classify Toronto neighborhoods with high, moderate & low density of Indian restaurants."
